    <p>
      My name is Song Kim, and I am interested in anything that is related to
      technology.<br />
      I have an AS degree in Electronics BS degree in Network and Communication
      Management.<br />
      My interest in Web Development arrived from my interest in technology as
      mentioned before.<br />
      Most of my previous employment were most technology related field as
      well.<br />
      I have worked as Network Administrator Intern, Electonics Engineering
      Technician in R&D, and Systems Engineer/Network Administator.<br />
      I am looking forward to be Web Developer in near future.
